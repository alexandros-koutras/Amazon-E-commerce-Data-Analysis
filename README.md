# Amazon Reviews Analysis

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that analyze Amazon product reviews.  
The goal of this project is to explore customer feedback data, perform preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply machine learning techniques to understand sentiment and review patterns.

## 📂 Contents
- **`amazonreviewss.ipynb`** – Initial exploration and preprocessing of Amazon reviews dataset. Includes text cleaning, visualization, and sentiment distribution.
- **`amazonreviews_part2.ipynb`** – Extended analysis with feature extraction, model training (e.g., sentiment classification), and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Exploratory data analysis (word clouds, frequency distributions, rating patterns)
- Sentiment analysis on review text
- Machine learning models for classification
- Performance evaluation with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy (data manipulation)  
- matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)  
- scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)  
- nltk / re (text preprocessing)  

## 📊 Example Insights
- Common words and phrases in positive vs. negative reviews  
- Relationship between review length and rating  
- Accuracy of machine learning models in predicting sentiment
